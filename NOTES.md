### Linear Search - Go one by one, by index to check the list/array to find the desired value
### Binary Search - Needs list/array to be sorted, split list in the middle, find if desired value equals, is lesser than or is greater than midpoint, cuts off half values if not equal, repeats until value found
### bogosort - randomizes values until list is sorted
